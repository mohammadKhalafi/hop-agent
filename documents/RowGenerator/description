To use fields, you must have a data row. A data row will automatically be generated by some transforms like a table input (if you ran the preview). If no data row exists add a “Generate rows” transform to create a row(s) in order to use fields or print variables or parameters etc.

The Generate rows transform outputs a specified number of rows that are empty or have a set of hard-coded fields. By default, the rows are empty; however they can contain a number of static fields.

This transform is used primarily for testing purposes. It may be useful for generating a fixed number of rows, for example, you want exactly 12 rows for 12 months.

Sometimes you may use Generate Rows to generate one row that is an initiating point for your pipeline. For example, you might generate one row that contains two or three field values that you might use to parameterize your SQL and then generate the real rows.

Examples: * To generate a row of sample data, add two action items to a pipeline. Add a Generate rows transform connected to Add constants. In Add constants, you can add fields to generate. In Generate rows, you can limit the number of rows. * To loop through 100 rows you could use a Generate rows and an “Add sequence” Action to the pipeline and connect them on a pipeline.
