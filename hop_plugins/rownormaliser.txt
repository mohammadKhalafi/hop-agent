Plugin: Row Normaliser

Description

The Row Normaliser transform converts the columns of an input stream into rows.
You can use this transform to normalize repeating groups of columns.
Important: When combining multiple columns with different meta types (e.g., String and Integer) into a new field, no automatic type conversion is performed. Instead the first meta type is set. This lack of conversion may lead to issues with subsequent transformations on the resulting data rows. It is strongly advised to ensure that the data types of values being put into the same field are aligned before normalization.


Options

Option | Description
Transform name | Name of the transform, this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
Typefield | The name of the type field (keyin the example below).
Fields table | A list of the fields you want to normalize; you must set the following properties for each selected field:* Fieldname: Name of the fields to normalize, as you get them from the input transform. * Type: Give a string to classify the field (you can use the same field names, or input custom strings). * New field: You can give one or more fields where the new value should transferred to (valuein our example).
Get Fields | Click to retrieve a list of all fields coming in on the stream(s).


Example


Example -> Input data

RecordID | FirstName | LastName | City
345-12-0000 | Mitchel | Runolfsdottir | Jerryside
976-67-7113 | Elden | Welch | Lake Jamaal
824-21-0000 | Rory | Ledner | Scottieview

Example -> Normalized data (example 1)

SetTypefield= "key" and use theGet Fieldsbutton to load all the fields for normalization, set alsoNew field= "value" in all rows. The result is:
key | value
RecordID | 345-12-0000
FirstName | Mitchel
LastName | Runolfsdottir
City | Jerryside
RecordID | 976-67-7113
FirstName | Elden
LastName | Welch
City | Lake Jamaal
RecordID | 824-21-0000
FirstName | Rory
LastName | Ledner
City | Scottieview

Example -> Normalized data (example 2)

Similar to example 1, but remove theRecordIDfield from theFields table. The result is:
RecordID | key | value
345-12-0000 | FirstName | Mitchel
345-12-0000 | LastName | Runolfsdottir
345-12-0000 | City | Jerryside
976-67-7113 | FirstName | Elden
976-67-7113 | LastName | Welch
976-67-7113 | City | Lake Jamaal
824-21-0000 | FirstName | Rory
824-21-0000 | LastName | Ledner
824-21-0000 | City | Scottieview
