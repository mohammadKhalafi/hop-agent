Plugin: Strings cut

Description

The Strings Cut transform cuts a portion of a (sub)string. If the designated field is out of range, it returns blank.


Options

Option | Description
Transform name | Name of the transform.
In stream field | Name of the field whose substring to cut.
Out stream field | When a field name is given here, the transform creates a new field with the substring. Otherwise the original field gets replaced by the substring.
Cut from | Designate where to begin cutting the substring. This value is 0-based, thus the first character in a string is 0.
Cut to | Designate where to end cutting the substring. This value is exclusive (1-based), so using a 1 includes the first character. The maximum length of the new string is Cut to minus Cut from.
