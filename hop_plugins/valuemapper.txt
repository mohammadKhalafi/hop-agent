Plugin: Value Mapper

Description

The Value Mapper transform maps string values from one value to another.
Mapping is usually solved by storing the conversion table in a database.
The Value Mapper provides you with a simple alternative.
For example, if you want to replace language codes:
Fieldname to use: LanguageCode
Target fieldname: LanguageDesc
Source/Target: EN/English, FR/French, NL/Dutch, ES/Spanish, DE/German, ...



Options

The following properties are used to define the mappings:
Option | Description
Transform Name | Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline.
Fieldname to use | Field to use as the mapping source
Target field name | Field to use as the mapping Target
Default upon non-matching | Defines a default value for situations where the source value is not empty, but there is no match
Field values table | Contains the mapping of source value to converted target value.
 | If there is an empty source value defined, we map null or empty string to the target value. Only one empty mapping is allowed.
