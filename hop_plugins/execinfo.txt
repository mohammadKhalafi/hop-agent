Plugin: Execution Information

Description

The Execution Information transform allows you to read (or delete) information from anExecution Information Location. Depending on which operation you select, different input options will be enabled. The output of the transform will be different as well. This means that this transform always needs input-rows in order to produce output.
Example to delete 200 Execution Idâs:First use Generate rows to create your fields and values to use (children: Boolean = true) and (limit: Integer = 200). Then use a first transform to get the ids (Operation: Get execution IDs), and a second connected transform to delete them (Operation: Delete execution). Optionally you can also delete by other fields such as date and ID. It can take a while to query the Execution Information, so keep an eye on the Duration column.
