Notes:
The date optionally referenced in the output file name(s) will be the start of the pipeline execution.
Hop Date types are serialized as EPOC: milliseconds since1970-01-01 00:00:00.000
Strings are written as binary in UTF-8
Compression of data into columnar format is being done in memory. This happens when all rows are written. To not run out of memory make sure to specify a split size.
