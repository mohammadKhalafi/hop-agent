Plugin: Stream Schema Merge

Description

The Stream Schema Merge transform merges multiple inputs with different structures and creates a combination of fields.
 | If the streams to merge contain fields with the same name but different types, these fields with be combined into a single field of typeString.If you want to make sure fields keep their original data type, make sure to convert them to identical types. e.g. through theMetadatatab in theSelect Valuestransform.
