Sort directory | The directory in which the temporary files are stored in case when needed; the default is the standard temporary directory for the system
TMP-file prefix | Choose an easily recognized prefix so you can identify the files when they show up in the temp directory.
Sort size | The more rows you store in memory, the faster the sorting process because fewer temporary files must be used and less I/O is generated.
