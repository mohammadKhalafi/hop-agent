Plugin: Beam Kinesis Consume

Description

The BeamKinesisConsume transform consumes (reads) messages from an Amazon Kinesis stream using the Beam pipeline execution engine.


Limitations

The main limitation of the Kinesis consumer is that it currently only supports reading String messages. Please create a request in GitHub if you want to see support for Avro messages and other formats.
