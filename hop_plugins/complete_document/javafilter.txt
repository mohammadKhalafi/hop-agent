Plugin: Java Filter

Description

The Java Filter transform allows the stream to be filtered using a user defined Java expressions.
The input stream, coming from one or more transforms, can be redirected to two different transforms based on the evaluation of the written expression.
In other words, the user is able to perform an if-statement to filter the data stream with pure java expressions:
if( Condition )
  {matching-transform}
else
  {non-matching transform}
