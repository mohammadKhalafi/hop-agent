Option | Description
Reference connection / Compare connection | Database connections from which the reference/compare table data will come.
Reference schema field / Compare schema field | contain the schema names for the reference/compare table.
Reference table field / Compare table field | contain the actual table names. This means that you could compare two tables with a different name, as long as they have the same column names.

Options -> Other fields tab
