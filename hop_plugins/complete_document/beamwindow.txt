Window Types


Window Types -> Fixed

Fixed or tumbling windows are used to repeatedly segment data into distinct time segments and do not overlap. Events cannot belong to more than one window.

Window Types -> Sliding

Sliding windows produce an output only when an event occurs and continuously move forward. Every window will have at least one event and can overlap. Events can belong to more than one window.

Window Types -> Session

Session windows group events which arrive at similar times and filter out periods of time when there is no data.
The window begins when the first event occurs and extends to include new events within a specified timeout. If events keep occurring the window will keep extending until maximum duration is reached.

Window Types -> Global

Global windowing is the default in Beam and ignores event time (spanning all of event time) and uses triggers to provide snapshots of that window.
