Plugin: Metadata Input

Description

The Metadata Input transform gives you access to the Hop Metadata items in the current project.
It outputs all the metadata objects of all types unless one or more types are filtered.


Options

You can specify the field names of the information you need, or not.
You can also specify one or more type filters to limit the output of the transform.
For example, you can select filter 'rdbms' to only see the relational database connection metadata in the output.
