Plugin: XSD Validator

Description

The XSD Validator transform performs an XSD validation against data in a file or in an input field.
XSD is short forXML Schema Definition.
As such, there are 2 entities at work here:
The XML you want to validate the layout for
The XSD (Schema) file that describes what the XML file should look like.
To make matters more complex, it’s possible to store the XSD inside the XML itself.
See also theXSD Validator workflow action.
