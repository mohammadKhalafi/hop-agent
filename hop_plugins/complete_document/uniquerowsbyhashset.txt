Plugin: Unique Rows (HashSet)

Description

The Unique Rows (HashSet) transform removes duplicate rows and filters only the unique rows as input data for the transform.
This transform differs from theUnique Rowspipeline transform by keeping track of the duplicate rows in memory and does not require a sorted input to process duplicate rows.


Options
