Fields tab -> Example Case: Retrieving Deleted Records from Salesforce

You want to retrieve all deleted records from Salesforce, even when the dataset exceeds the default pagination size of 2000 records.
Check the box labeledQuery all recordsin theAdvancedsection.
This allows the transform to retrieve all available records across multiple pages.
In theSettingstab, include the following query condition:IsDeleted = true
This ensures the transform retrieves only deleted records.
If "Query all records" is not enabled, the transform will retrieve only the first 2000 records due to Salesforce’s default pagination settings. Enabling "Query all records" ensures that the system processes all pages of data until all matching records are retrieved.
You want to retrieve all customer records deleted within the past 30 days. Configure your transform as follows:
Retrieve: Set toDeleted.
Query Condition:IsDeleted = true AND LastModifiedDate >= LAST_N_DAYS:30
If the transform retrieves fewer records than expected, verify thatQuery all recordsis enabled.
Ensure your Salesforce user has appropriate permissions to access deleted records.
