Plugin: Write to log

Description

The Write To Log transform writes information to the Hop logging system.
Typical use cases are logging specific values or custom logging messages to the Hop logs.


Usage

 | Be careful when writing variables or fields for (unencrypted) passwords or other sensitive information to the Hop logging system!
If no fields are added in the Write to log Fields list, it will write out all fields to the log if a Basic Log level is specified. If fields are added to Fields list it will only print out those field(s). Parameters and variables must be specified in the Log message section.
A Logging level must be set. Set the Log detail level to Basic if you want variables to be printed out.
Example to print a parameter or variable in the Log Message section:COUNTER: ${myCounter}
If a data row does not exist containing fields, logging fields, parameters, or variables will not work. You may use a "Generate rows" transform to create a dummy row in order to print variables or parameters.
 | If an error stops anything from being written to the log, then disable the Hops that fail, and add logging just before the failure, and re-run.
