Plugin: Insert / Update

Description

The Insert/Update transform first looks up a row in a table using one or more lookup keys. If a table row for the specified keys can’t be found, a new row is inserted.
If it can be found and the fields to update are the same, nothing is done.
If they are not all the same, the row in the table is updated.
