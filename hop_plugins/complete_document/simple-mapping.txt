Plugin: Simple Mapping

Description

The Simple Mapping transform allows you to re-use a series of transforms in the form of a "re-usable pipeline" also known as a "Mapping".


Options

The options are fairly self-explanatory:
Transform name: a unique name in your pipeline
Pipeline: The name of the mapping (sub-) pipeline to embed. This pipeline is executed separately and is considered a separate entity. It is always executed with a standard local Hop pipeline run configuration since that is currently the only one capable of streaming data into and out of transforms.
Parameters tab: specify the parameters you want to pass to the mapping pipeline
Input tab: specify which fields to pass to theMapping Inputtransform in the mapping. You can map (hence the name) field names.
Output tab: specify how to rename output fields retrieved from theMapping Outputtransform.


Sample

In the samples project you can find two examples of the Simple Mapping transform, the transforms/files/simple-mapping-child.hpl and simple-mapping-parent.hpl pipelines.
In the sample files discussed above, the parent pipeline sends first and last name fields to the child, a calculation is performed and then a field is populated with the calculation and sent back.
