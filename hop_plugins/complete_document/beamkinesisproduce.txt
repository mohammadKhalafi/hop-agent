Plugin: Beam Kinesis Produce

Description

The BeamKinesisProduce transform sends data (messages) to an Amazon Kinesis stream using a Beam pipeline execution engine.


Limitations

The main limitation of the Kinesis produce transform is that it currently only supports sending String data. Please create a request in GitHub if you want to see support for Avro messages and other formats.
