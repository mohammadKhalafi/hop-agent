Table to write to | Specify the name of the table to write to.
Consistency level | Please seeCassandra Write consistency levelsfor a list of possible values.
Commit batch size | The number of rows to update at once in each commit
Batch insert timeout | Specify the number of milliseconds to wait for a batch to completely insert before splitting into smaller sub-batches. You must specify a value lower than Socket timeout or leave empty for no timeout.
Sub batch size | Specify the sub-batch size (in number of rows) if the batch must be split because Batch insert timeout is reached.
Insert unlogged batches | Select if you want to use non-atomic batch writing. By default, batches are atomic (if any of the batch succeeds, all of it will succeed). Select this option to remove the atomic restriction.

Table creation WITH clause | Specify additions to the table creationWITHclause.
Truncate table | Select if you want any existing data to be deleted from the named table before inserting incoming rows.
Update table metadata | Select if you want to update the table metadata with information on incoming fields not already present. If this option is not selected, any unknown incoming fields are ignored unless the Insert fields not in column meta data option is selected.
Insert fields not in column meta data | Select if want to insert the table metadata in any incoming fields not present, with respect to the default table validator. This option has no effect if Update table meta data is selected.
