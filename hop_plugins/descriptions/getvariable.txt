Plugin: Get variables

Description

The Get Variables transform allows you to get the value of a variable and create field(s) from it. You only need to use this transform if you need the variable value in a field.
 | If you need to refer to a previous pipelineâs data row(s) fields, then use a Get rows from result transform.
