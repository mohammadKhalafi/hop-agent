Plugin: Synchronize after merge

Description

The Synchronize After Merge transform can be used in conjunction with the Merge Rows (Diff) pipeline transform to insert/update/delete database fields based on the Merge Rows (Diff) output.
The Merge Rows (diff) pipeline transform appends a Flag column to each row, with a value of "identical", "changed", "new" or "deleted".
This flag column is then used by the Synchronize After Merge pipeline transform to carry out updates/inserts/deletes on a connection table.
