Plugin: Reservoir Sampling

Description

The Reservoir Sampling transform allows you to sample a fixed number of rows from an incoming data stream when the total number of incoming rows is not known in advance.
The transform uses uniform sampling; all incoming rows have an equal chance of being selected.
This transform is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the ARFF output transform in order to generate a suitable sized data set to be used by WEKA.
