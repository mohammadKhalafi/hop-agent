Plugin: User Defined Java Class

Description

The User Defined Java Class transform allows you to enter User Defined Java Class to drive the functionality of a complete transform.
In essence, this transform allows you to program your own plugin in a transform.
The goal of this transform is not to allow a user to do full-scale Java development inside a transform.
Obviously we have a whole plugin system available to help with that part.
The goal is to allow users to define methods and logic with as little as code as possible, executed as fast as possible.
For this we use theJaninoproject libraries that compile Java code in the form of classes at runtime.
