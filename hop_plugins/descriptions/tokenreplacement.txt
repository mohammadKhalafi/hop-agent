Plugin: Token Replacement

Description

The Token Replacement transform replaces tokens in an input string or file.
The transform can then output this data either to a file or a field on the stream.
A token contains a start string, a name, and an end string.
For example ${my_token} could be a token.
The start string, and end string are configurable and can be any series of characters.
When replacing tokens in a file, this transform reads the entire file. It does not operate on a single line at a time. When replacing tokens in a file it is a best practice to output to a file also to prevent Hop from having to read the entire file into memory.
