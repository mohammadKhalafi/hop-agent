Plugin: Memory Group By

Description

The Memory Group By transform builds aggregates in a group by fashion.
This transform processes all rows within memory and therefore does not require a sorted input. However, itdoesrequire all data to fit into memory.
 | When the number of rows is too large to fit into memory, use a combination ofSort RowsandGroup Bytransforms.
