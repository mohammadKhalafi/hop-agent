Plugin: XML Join

Description

The XML Join transform adds xml tags from one stream into a leading XML structure from a second stream.
The target stream must have only one row, since it represents a XML document. The other stream can consist of many rows and the tags from all rows will be added to the target document.
Only one row will be produced after the join. This single row contains the fields of the target transform plus the result field of the join.
