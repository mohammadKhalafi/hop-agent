Plugin: Add Sequence

Description

The Add Sequence transform adds a sequence to the Hop stream. A sequence is an ever-changing integer value with a specific start and increment value.
You can either use a database sequence (if supported, e.g. Oracle, PostgreSQL) to determine the value of the sequence, or have it generated by Hop.
Hop-generated sequence values are unique when used in the same pipeline, and return to the same starting value each time you run the pipeline. Hop sequences are unique only when used in the same pipeline. Also, they are not stored, so the values start back at the same value every time the pipeline is launched.
