Plugin: Merge Join

Description

The Merge Join transform performs a classic merge join between data sets with data coming from two different input transforms.
This transform assumes your data is sorted on the join keys. UseSort Rowstransforms on the incoming streams to enforce sorting if necessary.
Join options include INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER, and FULL OUTER.
