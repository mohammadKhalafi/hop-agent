Plugin: Run SSH commands

Description

The Run SSH Commands transform allows you to execute commands over the secure shell (ssh) TCP/IP protocol.
You can pass text to stdout or stderr in the commands. This information can then be picked up by the transform and passed in a field to subsequent transforms.
