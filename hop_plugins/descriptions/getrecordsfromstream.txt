Plugin: Get records from stream

Description

The Get Records From Stream transform returns records that were previously generated by another pipeline in a workflow.
The records were passed to this transform using either the Copy rows to result transform or the Workflow Executor transform.
You can enter the metadata of the fields you are expecting from the previous pipeline in a workflow.
