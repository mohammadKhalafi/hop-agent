Plugin: Text File Input

Description

The Text File Input transform reads data from a variety of text-file types, including formats generated by spreadsheets and fixed width flat files.
The features of the transform allow you to read from a list of files or directories, use wild cards in the form of regular expressions, and accept generalized filenames from previous transforms.
