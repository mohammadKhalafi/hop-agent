Plugin: XSD Validator

Description

The XSD Validator transform performs an XSD validation against data in a file or in an input field.
XSD is short forXML Schema Definition.
As such, there are 2 entities at work here:
The XML you want to validate the layout for
The XSD (Schema) file that describes what the XML file should look like.
To make matters more complex, itâ€™s possible to store the XSD inside the XML itself.
